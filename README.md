# Supervised_Gender_Classification
In this project, I developed a supervised machine learning pipeline to classify gender from images using the Kaggle Gender Recognizer dataset. The key steps and technologies involved:

Dataset: Utilized the Kaggle Gender Recognizer dataset comprising labeled images of men and women.
Preprocessing: Images were resized, flattened, and combined into a feature matrix.
Models: Built and evaluated multiple classifiers, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Random Forest.
Optimization: Leveraged hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV to enhance model performance.
Results: Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy and classification reports to ensure robust performance.
This project showcased my skills in Python, OpenCV, and scikit-learn, and my ability to integrate image preprocessing with machine learning models.
